JavaScript Higher Order Functions :-

A higher-order function is a function that does one of the following:

Takes another function as an argument.
Returns another function as its result.
Higher-order functions help make your code more reusable and modular by allowing you to work with functions like any other value.

function fun() {
    console.log("Hello, World!");
}
function fun2(action) {
    action();
}

fun2(fun);

output:-
Hello, World

Advanced Techniques with Higher Order Functions
1. Function Composition
Function composition is the process of combining multiple functions to create a new function. The composed function applies multiple operations in sequence.
function add(x) {
    return x + 2;
}
function mul(x) {
    return x * 3;
}

function compose(f, g) {
    return function(x) {
        return f(g(x));
  };
}
var res = compose(add, mul)(4);
console.log(res);

output:-
10

2. Currying
Currying transforms a function that takes multiple arguments into a series of functions that each take one argument. This allows partial application of the function.
function mul(x) {
    return function(y) {
        return x * y;
  };
}
var mulFn = mul(2);
console.log(mulFn(5));

output:-
10

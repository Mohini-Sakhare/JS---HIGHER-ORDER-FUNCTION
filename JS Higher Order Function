JavaScript Higher Order Functions :-

A higher-order function is a function that does one of the following:

Takes another function as an argument.
Returns another function as its result.
Higher-order functions help make your code more reusable and modular by allowing you to work with functions like any other value.

function fun() {
    console.log("Hello, World!");
}
function fun2(action) {
    action();
}

fun2(fun);

output:-
Hello, World
